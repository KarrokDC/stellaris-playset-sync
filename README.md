# Stellaris Playset Sync

This tool is designed to make it easier to share playsets with friends before a multiplayer game, especially playsets where load order is critical. The goal was to be as simple as possible to use.

## Supported Platforms
 * Windows (only tested on Windows 10)

 This was a quick-and-dirty project to make my weekend MP games with my friends go smoother - unfortunately, I'm most comfortable with C# and thus for now this tool is Windows-only as the Mac/Linux UI for .NET Core is still rather limited. I don't have a Mac to test or compile the software on anyway. If you're handy with code you could make your own tool that uses the same JSON format.

## Features
 * Exporting an existing playset (to share)
 * Importing a playset shared by this tool
 * Automatic backups of the launcher DB before changes
